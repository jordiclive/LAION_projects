One common procedure to follow goes as follows:\n \n \nApply a clipper with an angled blade and short recommended bevel-angle (0-10 degrees).\nStart by trimming the thickened toenail from the bottom of the toe. The cut should be parallel to the edge of the toenail. Move toward the free edge of the toenail and remove any over-growth.\nFinish by trimming the nail by following the curve of the free edge.

Within the parentheses, you can define any class variables and methods, in addition to the special methods, such as __init__, which is called a constructor.

When they find out, fear quickly follows: Did I say something embarrassing? Reveal my inner desires? My deepest, darkest secret? New research from the Sorbonne reveals that our sleep speech isn\u2019t usually that saucy. But it can reveal clues into our dreams \u2013 and unravel mysteries about the sleeping brain.\n\nIn the first study of its kind, Dr. Isabelle Arnulf and her team at the European Sleep Research Laboratories found that we follow the same speech patterns while we sleep as we do when we\u2019re awake. We use proper syntax, mind our grammar, and pause for imaginary respondents to participate in the conversation. We are, however, three times more negative and 800 times more likely to curse as we slumber.\n\nYou probably won\u2019t disclose personal secrets, but you may allude to things or people you encountered during the day.

Can you help me out?                            Dallas is currently only one point back of Nashville and Vegas with games on hand against both. The loss of Miro Heiskanen earlier this week is something to keep an eye on given how close the wild card race is right now but don\u2019t be surprised if Dallas finds their way into the playoffs this year.","Vancouver is also only trailing a wild card berth by three points. They had a very rough start to the season but the mid-season hiring of Bruce Boudreau has given them a serious jolt and turned things around for them entirely. Given Calgary\u2019s success in the playoffs against Vancouver historically, rooting for this matchup would be even more ideal for the Flames.\n\nWinnipeg is also not far behind, only out of the playoffs by four points. Winnipeg has had their struggles this season and Hellebuyck isn\u2019t having his best year, but it isn\u2019t totally over for the Jets quite yet.\n\nFinally Anaheim isn\u2019t totally out of it either. They had a very strong start and surprising start to their season but have since fallen off and are now five points out of a wild card spot.\n\nThis is talking about the current playoff races in the NHL. There are eight teams that are currently vying for the last wildcard spot, and the author is saying that one of those teams, Dallas, is only 1 point behind Nashville and Vegas for that last playoff spot. The author is also saying that Dallas could make the playoffs because they have two more games against those other teams this season, and they lost their star defenseman Miro Heiskanen to an injury so that will be a major factor. The author is also saying that Vancouver and Winnipeg are close behind Dallas in the race for the wildcard, and that the loss of Golden Knights star goalie Marc-Andre Fleury for 4-6 weeks is good news for those teams because Fleury was dominating them in the regular season. The author is also saying that the Flames, who are currently 2nd in the Western Conference, have historically fared well against the Canucks in the playoffs and would like to see that matchup in the playoffs, which would help the Canucks get into the playoffs. Finally the author says that Anaheim is not totally out of the playoff race either, they are 5 points out with lots of games left to play. Does that make sense?

Drive in movie theaters originated in the 1930s, specifically in the USA, and experienced a period of widespread expansion and popularity in the 1950s and 1960s. As originally conceived, drive in theaters were similar to outdoor theaters, but with the additional feature of allowing vehicles to enter and park directly adjacent to the screen, so that passengers in the vehicles could view the movie from the comfort of their own transportation. These theaters were typically grassy outdoor areas with large screens and sufficient space for parked vehicles, though many drive in theaters eventually developed indoor screening space for bad weather and winter months. The initial concept for drive in theaters was developed by Richard Hollingshead, a movie theater entrepreneur, in 1933, though it was his cousin Earl C. Anthony who actually founded the first North American drive in theater later that year. The format experienced explosive growth during the 1950s, fueled by new technological innovations which allowed for widespread adoption of the concept, including the introduction of the videotape format for film distribution, and most importantly the technological development of \u201c abundant arrays of large high-power projection lights, which were attached to each car to provide illumination for the screen \u201d. The general trend for drive in movie theaters peaked during the 1960s, with the number of active drive in theaters peaking at around 4500 in the United States, but by the 1980s they had experienced significant decline due to the rise of home theater systems and multiplex cinema spaces.

In this case, the cannon and the cannonball together are the system and so the total momentum must remain constant, and this imposes the following relation between the cannonball velocity and the cannon recoil velocity:\n\nm_cannonball * v_cannonball = m_cannon * v_recoil\n\nOne can easily solve for the cannon recoil velocity as:\n\nv_recoil = v_cannonball * m_cannon \/ m_cannonball"],["How can I make money without working in a traditional job?","One option might be to start a side hustle or small business.

The fundamental idea that we perceive three spatial dimensions, or \"3D\", because we live in a 4D spacetime is very important. The theory of general relativity implies that the spacetime should be 'curved', which is the underlying physical reason that led to scientists hypothesizing the existence of a fourth spatial dimension. Many scientists have been actively working to uncover the location and characteristics of the additional spatial dimension, including string theory, which leads to different geometries beyond the spatial dimensions we are familiar with. If we could look and study the 4th dimension directly, this might help us uncover even more about the fundamental physical laws that govern our universe. In theory, this 4th spatial dimension would be an extra dimension parallel to our 3D space, including length, width, and height, and it could be quite large (billions of light-years across or even greater) or created as a potentially very tiny scale.

Baleen whales have a thick, comb-like filter above their mouths. They use this \"filter\" to filter out food and can eat a broad range of prey. These types of whales play a very important role in the ocean ecosystem, which means that whales in general have an important purpose. Baleen whales are often further categorized into several different types, each of which uses its mouth to filter different kinds of foods. The blue whale, for example, feeds on amphipods, krill, and a variety of small fish. Bowhead whales feed on plankton, sea urchins, crustaceans, and fish. The other good news is that thanks to many conservation organizations, whales have become much less commonly killed by human hunters.

The general rule is that meat should be flipped over when it has been cooking for half of the amount of time you plan to cook it, so if you plan to boil meat for 10 minutes, the meat should be flipped over after 5 minutes. Of course, you need to experiment with the thickness of your meat and the timing if you want to get the ideal time to cook a specific cut. The thinner the meat, the less time you'll need.

His theory was refuted at the time but in the mid-twentieth century, it was proven that the Earth\u2019s lithosphere is made up of several tectonic plates that are continually shifting, spreading apart, or coming together. An American geologist named Harry Hess first used the term 'plate tectonics' in the 1960s to describe the large-scale movements of the Earth\u2019s tectonic plates.

It's really common for people to have hurt feelings when they find out that someone is not interested in dating them, especially if they hoped the friendship could lead to a relationship.

The fundamental idea that we perceive three spatial dimensions, or \"3D\", because we live in a 4D spacetime is very important. The theory of general relativity implies that the spacetime should be 'curved', which is the underlying physical reason that led to scientists hypothesizing the existence of a fourth spatial dimension. Many scientists have been actively working to uncover the location and characteristics of the additional spatial dimension, including string theory, which leads to different geometries beyond the spatial dimensions we are familiar with. If we could look and study the 4th dimension directly, this might help us uncover even more about the fundamental physical laws that govern our universe. In theory, this 4th spatial dimension would be an extra dimension parallel to our 3D space, including length, width, and height, and it could be quite large (billions of light-years across or even greater) or created as a potentially very tiny scale. We don't know the exact location of the \"4th dimension\", but it might be possible to find clues about it through quantum gravity theory, experiments, or measurements.\n\nHere are a few examples of physics research studies that have been done to investigate the 4th spatial dimension and \"higher dimensional universes\":\n https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1502.01000\n https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/gr-qc\/0007045\n https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/mirage-or-new-physics\/"],["When I was growing up I had a lot of fun calling kids with acne pizza face.

This enables satellite radio services to offer a much larger variety of content with clearer sound quality than conventional radio broadcasting. In addition, satellite radio signals are relayed via satellites in Earth orbit, providing significantly wider reach and more reliable broadcasting than standard terrestrial radio signals. One final key distinction is that satellite radio is essentially a subscription service, with users required to pay a monthly fee in order to receive the service.

Check tire pressure once a month and rotate the tires every 5,000 miles.\n- Inspect all fluid levels regularly - all cars have various fluids that need to be monitored and replenished as necessary, including brake fluid, power steering fluid, windshield wiper fluid, transmission fluid, coolant, and brake and transmission fluids.

Would it be catastrophic, or could we live without it?","Hm, that is an interesting question! Overall I think Earth would be fine without the moon, but there would certainly be some disruptive consequences. The main issue would be the severe disruption of Earth\u2019s tides, as the moon is responsible for creating tides through its gravitational effects on the Earth. Without the moon, the tides would be much weaker, and this would have a major impact on ocean currents and coastal ecosystems. Moreover, the Moon also affects the Earth\u2019s rotation, and without the stabilizing effects of the Moon, the length of the day would gradually shorten until the Earth was tidally locked with the Sun, permanently presenting the same face to the Sun. This scenario might cause serious problems for terrestrial life, as it would significantly alter climate and weather patterns, leading to much more extreme seasons and possibly causing the extinction of many species. Overall however I would say that life on Earth would survive and eventually recover from the loss of the Moon, though it would take centuries for the Earth\u2019s rotation and tides to fully stabilize in the absence of the Moon. So in summary, Earth would definitely survive without the Moon, though the consequences would be quite severe in the short term.

General relativity is a description of the laws of physics relevant to very massive objects and the very large-scale structure of spacetime. The theory of relativity is primarily based on the principle that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers. That is, the laws of physics will be the same for all observers in inertial motion. A central consequence of this is that anyone who is not accelerating (i.e. with zero acceleration) will observe the speed of light to be the same in all directions. And as a result, it is not possible for this person to gain any significant information by travelling at a significant fraction of the speed of light. Additionally, the theory of relativity has fundamental implications for our understanding of space and time that contradict our traditional ideas about them. This includes the idea that the fixed speed of light makes it difficult to define an objective system of time and the constancy of the speed of light plays a critical role in the delay of information in the theory of relativity. These \u201cpostulates\u201d are known as the principle of relativity, the constancy of light"],["I found a baby rabbit in my yard.

This can happen for a variety of reasons related to the combination of butter, marshmallow cream, sugar and chocolate chips, which require very precise timing and temperatures in order to successfully produce a fudge with a smooth consistency - the fudge should be smooth and glossy, with a consistency that is not dry, crumbly or gritty. The temperature of the mixture upon adding the marshmallow cream is most important, so it is key to remove it from heat immediately when it reaches the correct temperature. And the mixture needs to be stirred constantly and thoroughly until the temperature has returned to below 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

Can you tell me who the protagonist is?","Synopsis\nPremise\nElden Ring takes place in the Lands Between, sometime after the destruction of the titular Elden Ring and the scattering of its shards, the Great Runes. Once graced by the Ring and the Erdtree which symbolizes its presence, the realm is now ruled over by the demigod offspring of Queen Marika the Eternal, each possessing a shard of the Ring that corrupts and taints them with power. As Tarnished \u2014 exiles from the Lands Between who lost the Ring's grace and are summoned back after the Shattering \u2014 players must traverse the realm to ultimately find all the Great Runes, restore the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord.[1][6][7]\n\nPlot\nThe Tarnished is one of many exiles called back to the Lands Between in hopes of repairing the Elden Ring and becoming the next Elden Lord. Early on in their journey, the Tarnished encounters a young woman named Melina, who offers to stand in as their maiden to help them on their journey, under the condition that the Tarnished bring her to the base of the Erdtree where she can fulfill her purpose. She also takes the Tarnished to the Roundtable Hold, a gathering place for other Tarnished seeking to repair the Elden Ring. There, the Tarnished learns from their divine benefactor, the Two Fingers, that in the wake of the Shattering and Queen Marika's disappearance, her demigod children had taken the Great Runes, pieces of the Elden Ring, for themselves, and now war against each other to try and obtain the other Great Runes. The last known Great Rune holders are Godrick the Grafted, General Radahn, Praetor Rykard, Morgott the Grace-Given, Malenia the Blade of Miquella, and Rennala of the Full Moon.\n\nThe Tarnished then proceeds to journey into the Lands Between, investigating its various locales and defeating each demigod one by one until they recover enough Great Runes that the Two Fingers feels they are ready to journey to the Erdtree to confront Morgott, the final obstacle to the tree. Upon his defeat, Morgott claims that the Erdtree will not allow anybody, especially a Tarnished, to enter it before passing away. The Tarnished confirms this when they approach the Erdtree and find their way blocked by a wall of thorns. Melina then arrives and advises that they journey to find the Flame of Ruin, which they can use to set the Erdtree on fire and burn away the thorns. In light of the Tarnished being rebuffed from the Erdtree, the Two Fingers withdraws from the mortal plane to consider its next move, leaving the Tarnished free to proceed with Melina's plan or search for the imprisoned Three Fingers to gain the power of the Frenzied Flame.\n\nUpon obtaining the Flame of Ruin, if the Tarnished did not free the Three Fingers, then Melina will take the flame and sacrifice herself to set the Erdtree on fire. If the Tarnished freed the Three Fingers, then Melina will abandon the Tarnished, forcing them to use their own power to set the Erdtree on fire. Regardless, the Tarnished then proceeds to the Erdtree, where they battle the fellow Tarnished warrior Gideon Ofnir the All Knowing, as well as the First Elden Lord Godfrey to gain access to the interior of the Erdtree. Inside, they fight the reanimated remains of Queen Marika's consort, Radagon, as well as the godlike Elden Beast. Upon vanquishing both foes, the Tarnished finally gains access to Queen Marika's shattered corpse, which contains the remains of the Elden Ring. Depending on the Tarnished's actions throughout the game, six different endings are possible, ranging from the Tarnished becoming the Elden Lord in some form, allowing Marika to be usurped by Ranni the Witch, to using the Frenzied Flame to destroy the Erdtree and the Lands Between.[8]"],["How can I cook a healthy meal?","To cook a healthy meal, start by selecting nutritious ingredients.

This innovative startup financial approach to the postal system also significantly reduced counterfeiting and saved government money, making it one of Franklin's most successful projects. \n\nSince its founding, the United States Postal Service has expanded in both size and scope. Today it is overseen by the USPS Board of Governors and the United States Postal Regulatory Commission, and employs over 500,000 US workers. Its service area in the US includes over 120,454 ZIP code areas, and it delivers around 170 billion pieces of mail annually. It is considered one of the largest transportation systems in the world, handling hundreds of shipments per second through a fleet of almost 260,000 vehicles.  \n\nThe USPS also pays out billions of dollars in dividends to the federal government annually, and is one of the most profitable public services in the US.

If your bag has a reflective coating, it will hold heat better and be warmer in colder temperatures. Warm air stays thermally trapped in your sleeping bag and slowly radiates heat back to you in colder temperatures.

But did kids in the 1700's do the same thing except they would pretend to do the loading procedure for a musket every time they \"shoot?\"","Hmm, interesting question! Based on my research, it seems like kids around the 1700's probably did in fact often pretend to do the loading procedure for a musket or similar firearm every time they \"shot\" their imitated gun. The repetitive re-loading process would have likely been very familiar to children at the time, as this was the standard procedure for actual musket use, so it would make sense that they would want to imitate this in their play. \n\nIt seems that stick guns veered away from the loading procedure and simply kept repeating the rapid fire imitation, starting in the 1920's. This is likely due to the invention of more efficient repeating firearms such as the M-16 in the US, and also the increasing usage of these more efficient repeating rifles in military conflicts. So kids now imitate the fast firing and lack of reloading in their stick gun play, as they would do with real modern day firearms. \n\nHope this helps!

I thought only universities would have that","Yeah Japanese high schools do indeed have entrance exams for all students admitted to the school. This is primarily a legacy of the tradition of prestigious prep schools, known as \u201cjuku\u201d, which served as a way to prepare students for the fierce competition and extremely demanding high school entrance exams. Nowadays however there is much less competition and the exams have become largely a way to evaluate student performance and help prepare them for university entrance exams. \n\nTypically students begin studying for the entrance exams in 6th grade (equivalent to 9th grade in the US), and continue studying for the remainder of their high school years in order to prepare for the difficult exam. The entrance exams are quite competitive, with only about 20% of test-takers being accepted into prestigious high schools in Tokyo. As such, considerable time and effort is put into preparing for the exams. \n\nFinally, the main motivation for this testing system is to provide rigid curricular structure and consistent standards of academic performance within Japanese high schools, which would otherwise vary considerably between schools. As a result, the entrance exams help provide uniform academic standards and curricular program throughout the school system, thus facilitating high school education and preparation for university."],["What are the health benefits of flax seed?","The health benefits of flax seed include improved digestion, reduced cholesterol levels, and improved metabolism.

Kleenex began during the First World War. It developed a crepe paper used as a filter for gas masks. In the early 1920s, it was adapted as a consumer product called Kotex brand to help women with their periods.[1] The Kotex trademark was derived from the combination of the words \"cotton\" and \"texture.\" The company itself has confirmed that this name was chosen as it \"met [their] requirements for being short, easy to say, easy to remember and easy to explain.\" In 1924, the name Kleenex was selected as the name for a line of cold cream remover, as such, the \"Kleen\" portion of the name denotes its cleansing purpose. The \"ex\" was added to show that Kleenex was of the family of products that included Kotex.[2] The first Western facial tissue was introduced in 1924 and originally marketed as a way to remove cold cream (it had already been in use in Japan for centuries; see History of facial tissue for details).[3] It was a disposable substitute for face towels or cotton wool. In 1925, the first Kleenex tissue ad was used in magazines showing \"the new secret of keeping a pretty skin as used by famous movie stars.\" A few years after the introduction of Kleenex, the company's head researcher tried to persuade the head of advertising to try to market the tissue for colds and hay fever. The administrator declined the idea but then committed a small amount of ad space to mention of using Kleenex tissue as a handkerchief. By the 1930s, Kleenex was being marketed with the slogan \"Don\u2019t Carry a Cold in Your Pocket\" and its use as a disposable handkerchief replacement became predominant.[4] In 1943, Kleenex began licensing the Little Lulu cartoon character to popularize the brand.[5]","This article is about the popular facial tissue brand \"Kleenex\" (brand owned by Kimberly-Clark), describing its early history and development as a product, and how it became well known and popular as the first brand of facial tissue to massively replace the use of handkerchiefs for blowing noses at the turn of the twentieth century.

There are a few ways to assess the need for replacement. Most important is the overall condition of the wipers themselves, specifically looking for any cracks or deformation in the rubber blade. If the wipers are overall in good condition but seem to be wearing down and wiping less effectively, then you should probably replace them. Another way to assess need is to measure the actual arc of the wipers across your windshield. A rough guideline for replacement is if the wipers no longer cover at least half of the windshield when fully extended. Also, be sure to check that your wipers are actually creating good contact with the windshield, as they can become disengaged from the rubber blades over time. Finally, if your wipers are only partially effective or leave streaks on the window even when fully extended, then they probably need to be replaced. Overall, wiper replacement is something that should be done on a regular maintenance schedule to ensure safe and effective operation of your vehicle. I hope this helps!

On September 11, 2001, 19 al-Qaeda suicide hijackers took control of four planes  while passengers were in flight. The hijackers hoped to use these planes to attack and destroy important buildings in the United States, such as the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, the White House, and the Capitol building. The terrorists stabbed and killed flight attendants and planned to crash the planes into these locations, causing numerous casualties. The hijackers did not realize that passengers on the planes would revolt, leading to their failure in destroying the Pentagon, the World Trade Center, and The White House. The plane that crashed in Shanksville was also intended to hit either the United States Capitol or the White House, but passengers forced the hijackers to crash into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania instead. This resulted in accepting severe weakening of the resistance on the planes, as the hijackers were forced to use knives and box cutters instead of guns, and generally disoriented the other passengers as well. Only three of the planes reached their targets, as passengers forced the other hijacked planes to crash into other locations. The casualty count including hijackers resulted in slightly over 3,000 people killed. A mass terrorist attack of this scale was unprecedented, and resulted in major changes to the United States government and its department of Homeland Security. The attacks galvanized nations and altered economies, institutions, laws, and culture.
